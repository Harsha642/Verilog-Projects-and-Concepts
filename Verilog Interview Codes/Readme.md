Q1) Write a verilog code to swap contents of two registers with and without a temporary register?
Ans) 
With temp reg ;

always @ (posedge clock)
begin
temp=b;
b=a;
a=temp;
end

Without temp reg;

always @ (posedge clock)
begin
a <= b;
b <= a;
end


Q2)Create a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer. The 256 4-bit inputs are all packed into a single 1024-bit input vector. sel=0 should select bits in[3:0], sel=1 selects bits in[7:4], sel=2 selects bits in[11:8], etc ?

module top_module (
	input [1023:0] in,
	input [7:0] sel,
	output [3:0] out
);

	// We can't part-select multiple bits without an error, but we can select one bit at a time,
	// four times, then concatenate them together.
	assign out = {in[sel*4+3], in[sel*4+2], in[sel*4+1], in[sel*4+0]};

	// Alternatively, "indexed vector part select" works better, but has an unfamiliar syntax:
	// assign out = in[sel*4 +: 4];		// Select starting at index "sel*4", then select a total width of 4 bits with increasing (+:) index number.
	// assign out = in[sel*4+3 -: 4];	// Select starting at index "sel*4+3", then select a total width of 4 bits with decreasing (-:) index number.
	// Note: The width (4 in this case) must be constant.

endmodule
