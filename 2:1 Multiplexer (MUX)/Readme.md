What is Multiplexer?
A Multiplexer (or mux;), also known as a data selector, a combinational logic circuit,  is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line.[1] The selection is directed by a separate set of digital inputs known as select lines. A multiplexer of {\displaystyle 2^{n}}2^{n} inputs has {\displaystyle n}n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the outpu

assign y = sel ? a : b ;
This operator ? means that the output 'y' becomes equal to data 'a' if select line 'sel' is true otherwise 'b' is the final output.
